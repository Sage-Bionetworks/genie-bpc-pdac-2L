## Introduction

This report addresses the feasibility of forming a cohort.  Specifically, the goal is finding a suitable control arm foran  Astellas study of second line therapies in metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).  We will leverage the existing curation in the pancreatic BPC (v1.2-consoritum) cohort, with plans to curate images further if the initial submission goes well.

## Attrition table

The following table applies trial inclusion criteria to GENIE participants, showing how many are eliminated at each step.  We'll show the table first, and detailed explanations follow below.  Each step in the table is cumulative, meaning that the third row states the number who meet the conditions in the first, second and third rows, and so on.

```{r}
flow_track <- readr::read_rds(
  here('data', 'flow_track.rds')
)

flow_track_ft <- flow_track %>%
  mutate(n = map_int(pt_dat, nrow)) %>%
  select(message, n) %>%
  flextable() %>%
  set_header_labels(message = "Cohort description", n = "n") %>%
  theme_booktabs() %>%
  align(j = "n", align = "right") %>%
  fontsize(size = 10) %>%
  autofit() 
```

```{r}
#| include: true
flow_track_ft
```

Details:

- **BPC PANC v1.2** The biopharma collaborative pancreatic cancer dataset, version 1.2-consortium.
- **PDAC tumor** - At least one sample for each person had the oncotree code for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma (PAAD) or Adenosquamous Carcinoma of the Pancreas (PAASC), leaving out anyone with only Acinar Cell Carcinoma of the Pancreas (PAAC) and Undifferentiated Carcinoma of the Pancreas (UCP) samples.
- **US sites only** Eliminated UHN (Canada) from the cohort.
- **Only one cancer** The only cancer these people had is the pancreatic cancer that qualifies them for the cohort.  Only about 30 people had multiple cancers with pancreatic first, so it's almost certainly not worth it to open the can of worms that comes with trying to figure out which therapy counts for which cancer.
- **Met dx. (anytime)** Limits to those who had a metastatic diagnosis at some point.  We will check the timing of the metastatic diagnosis with the index therapy later.
- **KRAS G12D+** Had the mutation of interest in at least one NGS test (see note below on timing).
- **1L gem/5FU-based** - The first line of therapy includes either gemcitabine or 5-FU (Fluorouracil).  Using the wording in inclusion criterion #3 from the protocol, lines of therapy start with this exposure even if the exposure is before metastasis.
- **Met @ index line** - the person is metastatic at the index therapy, which is either one or two therapies after the gem/5fu exposure.  That is, the index line is 2L or 3L.
- **No investigational** - the person had no investigational agents included in any therapies from the gem/5-FU to the index therapy.
- **Documented prog after 1L** - complicated, see *Progression* section below.



```{r}
demo_dat <- readr::read_rds(
  here('data', 'baseline_char.rds')
)
```


## Demographics

The following table shows the demographics for the group meeting all inclusion criteria:

```{r}
#| include: true
gtsummary::tbl_summary(
  select(demo_dat, -record_id),
  digits = list(
    `Year of birth` ~ 0
  )
)
```



## Progression

Progression is defined as having at least one radiologist summary indicating a worsening.  See change notes below on this.

## Lines

We begin counting regimens as lines of therapy when either of the following happens:

1. Exposure to gemcitabine or 5-FU (even if they precede the metastatic diagnosis).
2. Any therapy given in the metastatic setting.

Additionally, we do not count consecutive regimens using the same drugs as a new line of therapy.  For example, if a patient's first three captured regimens are FOLFIRINOX, FOLFIRINOX, Gemcitabine + Nabpaclitaxel, then we would say their first line is FOLFIRINOX and the second line is Gemcitabine + Nabpaclitaxel.  That is, the second second administration of FOLFIRINOX is not a new line but the continuation of an old line.

If desired, we can always expand this concept to say that similar regimens do not count as new lines.  For example, if someone goes from FOLFIRINOX to FOLFOX you could argue this dropping one for toxicity rather than a new line.

```{r}
lot <- readr::read_rds(here('data', 'drug', 'lot.rds'))
cohort <- readr::read_rds(here('data', 'cohort_prog_verified.rds'))
```

The following table shows all the first line (gem/5-FU) therapies:

```{r}
#| include: true

lot %>%
  filter(record_id %in% cohort$record_id) %>%
  filter(line_of_therapy %in% 1) %>%
  count(regimen_drugs, sort = TRUE) %>%
  dt_wrapper(
    .,
    cap = "Regimens for the Gem/5-FU exposure (1L)",
    page_length = 10
  )
```

This table shows the therapies used in the index line (either 2L or 3L):

```{r}
#| include: true

cohort %>%
  select(record_id, line_of_therapy = index_line) %>%
  left_join(., select(lot, record_id, line_of_therapy, regimen_drugs),
            by = c('record_id', 'line_of_therapy')) %>% 
  count(regimen_drugs, sort = TRUE) %>%
  dt_wrapper(
    .,
    cap = "Regimens for index therapy (2L/3L)",
    page_length = 10
  )
```

**Note:** Lots of these are Gem and 5-FU, too, which may or may not be what the sponsor was expecting.


```{r}
met_sum <- readr::read_rds(
  here('data', 'met_site_sum.rds')
)
```

## Sites of metastasis

The following table shows the number (%) of patients with a distant metastasis at select body regions when they begin the index therapy.  As discussed, more detailed information (ICD-O-3 codes) on metastatic sites can be mined from the imaging data if needed.

```{r}
#| include: true
gtsummary::tbl_summary(
  select(met_sum, -c(record_id))
) %>%
  modify_header(label = "**Met at index therapy**")

```


## Important changes

- Jul 2025: Added tables: baseline characteristics and metastatic sites at index therapy.
- Jul 2025: The first draft of our progression algorithm allowed for progression defined by a drug switch, only in participants that had no medical oncologist or imaging assessments after starting first line therapy.  This has been removed (**Impact: ~-3 cases**).
- Jul 2025: Previously we only included progression events which occurred >=6 weeks and <=6 months after 1L therapy.  After learning this does not match the Astellas protocol we removed this (**Impact: ~+30 cases, OS longer**).
- Jul 2025: Originally progression was determined by either medical oncologist or imaging note.  We changed to just imaging to align with the target trial progression definition and the definition of response, which both use imaging only (**Impact:-18 cases**).


## Miscellaneous notes

- Using oncotree codes, we counted PAAD and PAASC as PDAC while PAAC and UCP are not.  Here are the four types present in the data:
    - Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma (PAAD)
    - Adenosquamous Carcinoma of the Pancreas (PAASC)
    - Acinar Cell Carcinoma of the Pancreas (PAAC)
    - Undifferentiated Carcinoma of the Pancreas (UCP)
